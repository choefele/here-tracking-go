# here-tracking-go
here-tracking-go is a Go client library for accessing the [HERE Tracking API v2](https://developer.here.com/documentation/tracking/api-reference-swagger.html).

Note: the implementation's interfaces aren't final yet â€“ expect changes

## Device Client

### Credentials
To use the device client, you need to:

1. Sign up for a developer account with HERE Tracking.
2. In the vendor role, create some devices with device licenses.
3. In the user role, claim those devices.

The device licenses include device IDs and device secrets.

### Building the Sample Application
You'll need a valid `$GOPATH` and working Go setup.

Install with `go get`:

```
$ go get -u github.com/choefele/here-tracking-go/cmd/ingest
```

Then run `ingest` providing the device ID and secret:

```
$ ingest <device ID> <device secret>
```

This will send test location data to the HERE Tracking Service, which you can monitor in the [admin console](https://app.tracking.here.com/).

## Usage
 ```go
import "github.com/choefele/here-tracking-go/pkg/tracking"
```

Construct a new client, then use the various services on the client to access different parts of the API. For example:

```go
func main() {
	if len(os.Args) < 3 {
		fmt.Println("Usage: ingest device_id device_secret")
		os.Exit(-1)
	}

	client := tracking.NewDeviceClient(os.Args[1], os.Args[2])
	dr := &tracking.DataRequest{
		Timestamp: tracking.Time{Time: time.Now()},
		Position: &tracking.Position{
			Lat:      52,
			Lng:      13,
			Accuracy: 100,
		},
	}
	err := client.Ingestion.Send(context.Background(), []*tracking.DataRequest{dr})
	fmt.Printf("Send: done, error: %v\n", err)
}
```

The services of a client divide the API into logical chunks and correspond to the structure of the [HERE Tracking API v2](https://developer.here.com/documentation/tracking/api-reference-swagger.html).
